# A sample bot for LINE Things Starter with automatic communication

Please make sure to confirm that the LINE Things Starter device with your own LINE Things product Service UUID is working fine before doing this.

## Register "Scenario set"

In order for you to have an automatic communication action perform, you first need to register and set a scenario to the LINE Things server prior to usage.

```sh
$ curl -v -X PUT https://api.line.me/things/v1/products/<YOUR PRODUCT ID>/scenario-set \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <CHANNEL ACCESS TOKEN>" \
-H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
-d '
{
  "autoClose": false,
  "suppressionInterval": 0,
  "scenarios": [{
    "trigger": {	
      "type": "BLE_NOTIFICATION",
      "serviceUuid": "<YOUR SERVICE UUID>",
      "characteristicUuid": "62FBD229-6EDD-4D1A-B554-5C4E1BB29169"
    },
    "actions": []
  }]
}'
```
